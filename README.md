# wave - An Advanced Sine Oscillator for Windows

`wave` is something I made for a recent science project that was good enough to win in a science fair. It can generate a .WAV file using a frequency and amplitude and play it instantly.

## Features

- Generates a .WAV file and plays it automatically
- Converts frequency to a harmonic note
- Very customizable with its inputs (length, bit rate, etc.)
- Simple and easy to utilize

## Usage

To use `wave`, simply build the program using Visual Studio or another C++ compiler. The program will then let you input a frequency and amplitude once opened. You can edit the code to suit your needs.

## That's All

I hope this simple yet cool project was useful and helpful for you. Although I probably won't update this project, feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Thanks!
